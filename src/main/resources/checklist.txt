sensor configuration file preparation
=====================================
- if not exists, create sensor file
- test sensor in Eclipse test run

copy grid and graphs
====================
trivial


make a link to datasets
=======================
Remark: in case of Intel Berkeley datasets, make a soft link to the directory
that contains all datasets. This has to be done before creating the config,
because a simulation configuration file has to be created for every dataset file

It might be more preferable to actually copy the datasets, because this makes
copying the experiment setup to the cluster easier

copy sensor configuration files to directory
============================================
trivial

create simulation config files
==============================
- create template simulation file
- create replacements file
- run wizard 'confgen' to generate simulation files in directory 'simulation'

create iridis scripts
=====================
Remark: these scripts are designed to run two simulations on the same node.

- check running time by editing the line "#PBS -l walltime=4:00:00"
- check for sufficient by editing the line 'memory java_args="-Xms128m
-Xmx768m"'
- check sensor configuration filename (variable 'sensor')
- add a line 'sleep 2' to make sure the simulations are not started at the same
time. This might cause problems while creating output directories
- in iridis script, check that the directory is changed to the correct directory
name (iridis runs scripts from home directory)
- run wizard 'irgen' to generate
- make sure you have the submitter.sh script in every directory

copy experiments jarfile to directory
=====================================


iridis
======

- Copy archive to iridis
- make sure that there is enough diskspace. If necessary, use the scratch directory and make a symbolic link to that directory from the home directory
- make sure that the job queue is empty
- use the submitter.sh script to submit the jobs
